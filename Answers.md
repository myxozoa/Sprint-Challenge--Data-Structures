* Queue
    Queues are First in First out (FIFO), which means that you place items into the queue from the back building to the front where they can be removed.

# Question 2
## What is the retreival time complexity for the following data structures?

* Linked List  
  - O(n)
* Hash Table  
  - O(1)
* Binary Search Trees  
  - O(log n)

# Question 3
## What are some advantages to using a Hash Tables over an array in JavaScript?

Hash tables achieve constant time for basically all operations and with the use and can be more safely/cleanly reasoned about with larger amounts of data.
